# Why Source?

Source gives you complete freedom to design and manage your e-commerce page as you see fit. Source will take care of the back end whilst allowing you to optimize the front end. Link your Source account to Stripe to start selling. 

Although large e-commerce platforms have certain advantages for novice sellers, Source allows you to scale more efficiently and take your business to the next level. Done are the days of basic templates where each e-commerce site looks and feels the same. Source brings a fresh modular environment for you to create engaging and responsive e-commerce sites. 

Once Source is embedded into your code, your store management will never be easier. Create, modify & remove products with a simple click. Your product stock will automatically be updated after every sale whilst gaining data on key metrics.

Our goal is to give developpers the freedom to design amazing pages without feeling hindered.
