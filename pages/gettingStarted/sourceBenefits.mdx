# Source Benefits

**We are some of the numerous benefits to using Source for your e-commerce store :** 

- `Clean code` : By simply calling your product data within the code, you do not need to embed several layers of code to achieve your goal. Simply call your products’ data via our API (@Kevin un bout de code ici!)

- `Freedom to build` : Don’t feel held back by outdated templates and large e-commerce platforms telling you what you can and can’t do. Using Source gives you maximum control over your website. Want to add something new? That’s easy! Want to trial a new promotion? Source can do it. 

- `Product management` : Manage your whole product list within Source. Have visibility on all your sales as well as you remaining stock, allowing you to add, modify & remove products effortlessly from out store. 

- `Framework adapted` : Source is compatible with the most popular frameworks such as React/Angular/Vue.Js. We work anywhere, with anything! 

- `Save time` : Instead of needing to code each product specificity within the code, simply call the “product ID” via our Source API, saving you precious coding time. This is true for when you add,modify or delete new products. 

- `Price` : Our price is based on a fixed % of your store turnover. If you do not sell you do not pay. 

- `SEO` : @Kevin Can you help me write this section? 

- `Security` : Source is compliant with W3C in terms of security. Your data and your clients data will always be protected.
