# Payements Methods

Our goal is to keep it simple for the user and the end customer. You will be able to connect or create (if you do not have one) a Stripe account that will link itself. Once it has been linked, you are ready to sell ! You are also able to connect PayPal as a payment method. 

## Stripe

Follow the simple sign in steps and you will redirected straight back to your dashboard with your payment plan set up. 

## PayPal

Follow the simple sign in steps and you will be redirected straight back to your dashboard with the payment plan set up.
