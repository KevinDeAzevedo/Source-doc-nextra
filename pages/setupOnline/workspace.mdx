# Workspace

Each workspace corresponds to a single shop. If you are a developper that updates and maintains e-commerce websites, each store will have a different workspace. From your workspace you will have the ability to add another workspace, rename your current one of delete an existing workspace. 

The notion like table will be fully modular, allowing you to display what you want, how you want. Filter by size, price, category or any other criterion of your choice. 

From this one page you can manage all the products you are selling.
