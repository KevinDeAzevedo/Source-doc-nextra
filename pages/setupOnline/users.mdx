# Users

This section of the dashboard allows you to have visibility on any team member you have invited to your workspace. From this page you can invite team members, modify permissions and delete users from your workspaces. 

To invite someone to Source, send them an invitation via the users page, prompting them to create an account with Source. Your accounts will then be linked via your workspace. 

Each member will have different permissions (read/write/delete)

**Each member profile will contain the following information :** 

- `ID (Staff Account )` : A unique number that will be generated by Source.
- `Name (Staff member name)` : Their full name
- `E-mail (Account e-mail)` : The email account that the person has used to sign up to Source
- `Invite accepted` : See the status of whether your invitation has been accepted/opened and whether their account has been succesfully linked.
- `Workspaces` : See what different workspaces the users have access to.

The status of each account must be editable and you also have the opportunity to delete or revoke certain rights. 

One team member can belong to more than one workspace in which they can have different permissions for each workspace.
