# Filter the board

Filter your product board by adding the elements you’d like to see in the new view. The new view will contain all of these elements and will be a seperate tab in your workspace table. Your main product list will always remain available as the first tab and will be modulable. This will allow you to manage your lists in the most efficient way possible. 

**Potential ideas :** 

- Create a new view based on your low stock

- Create a new view based on a single category (display all shoes/all tshirts ….)

- Create a new view based on a promotional event (-10 % on all black colours for black friday) 

- Create a new view based on the most succesfull products.
