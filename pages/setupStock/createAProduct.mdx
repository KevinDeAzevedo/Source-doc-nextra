# Create a product

The first step in creating a product from scratch is defining it. Define whether it is a unique item or a stocked item. From there we can add many different properties to your product such as : 
- `Size` / `Colour` / `Price` / `Stock` / `Photos` / `Unique ID` / `Link`

Certain properties will allow you to add many differing options as youâ€™d like to help you be as accurate as possible when classying your products. 

- `Size` : You can parametre different lenghts or sizes depending on your type of product. 
- `Colour` : Add as little or as many colour palettes as you wish 
- `Photos` : Add one or several photos to a single product. 
  
Linking two products together can allow you to create relationships between the products. You could for example link all items together that will appear in a Christmas Discount.
